              The number of video game consumers increases every year and its market offer is wide, oscillating between consoles (Xbox, PC, switch, PlayStation ...), genres or personal interests. When the user wants to find a video game suitable for
              the him/her, this issue can sometimes be overwhelming, so an online recommender that shows options according to what the user is looking for is a widely satisfactory tool.

                    Not only studying the market is necessary. Knowing the target audience and knowing what their real needs are is essential for the good development of the product. They are the end users, the consumers, they must be heard. I
                    consider that this is the best way to know exactly what they are looking for. For this I conducted personal interviews with a group of regular players and certain online surveys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the online surveys I focused mainly on establishing a ranking of priorities in terms of filtering searches, to find out what they consider more basic and what not, or more secondary. This will be important and will be clearly
                    reflected in how the searches will be structured.

              Even though, where I could gather more information was from the interviews. From them I got very valuable information to create a really interesting website for the user and not one to only use very occasionally. The most important
              point is to keep the web up to date with news and information from video games, mainly on issues of updates or bugs, offers, etc. The idea is not to create a news blog, but to show users which games have the most attention from their
              creators.

              After analyzing the results I reached several conclusions that together with the market analysis explained above, I will comment on the following point.

                  Actually there is <b>not a clear reference</b> for a online video game recommender. There are just a bunch of different websites that seems to just show them mighty interesting video games, but not having in consideration users
                  real likes or what they are more interested about.

                    At the same time their <b>navigation and usability</b> is very poor in most of these websites. This is very important due to people tend to perceive attractive products as more usable. <b>Marketing strategy and SEO</b> is very poor on
                    this websites too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, even though a recommender is an element every video game consumer will like to use from time to time, just with that service it <b>isn’t enough</b> to create an stable website. That said, creating a
                    <b>community</b> which players can punctuate and comment which games they like most or no is a very interesting idea. Also creating <b>reward system</b> having in consideration users contributions making their profile stand out
                    and establishing a ranking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Information about which games have updates, next releases, etc. is another big point to consider, along with facilitating access to buy them.

                    All of them are profiles that benefit from being able to filter searches, but you have to take into account that not everyone reaches with the same level of depth, so you have to establish a good hierarchy so that it is both

                    To begin to know how our website should be structured it is very useful to create a map with the path that a user would take in a given scenario and with a clear objective. Such as buying a new game. I decided to create 3, each
                    with an action that could be performed by any of the people created in the previous step and divided into different phases according to the actions that are required.

                    how important it is not to make the search too long, as it will cause the user to get bored. Do not let him lose that emotion of looking for a new game to enjoy.

                The next step was <b>wireframing</b>. Once I knew what I wanted and defined the core functionalities, I started creating low-fidelity wireframes, in order to get a
                more reliable design, but still being able to change this easily.

                    Once the main pages of this application have been created, I decided it was time to try it with some user to be able to check how easy or complicated it can be to navigate through it and in case of encountering any problem, find
                    the best possible <b>solution</b>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I could carry out the test with 4 <b>participants</b>. I chose those people knowing they could be real users. Somehow each of them match one persona. That was totally on purpose, because what I wanted was to approach the most to
                    every pontential profile user going through the website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After conducting the interviews and analyzing each participant individually, I grouped similar thoughts or actions to create an <b>affinity map</b> so I could know with more security which were real big pain points or maybe just
                    an isolated action.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All this process allowed me to gather some <b>crucial feedback</b> to help me decide what to include in the final experience, what to change, or even what to remove.

                  The pallete is composed by a primary and secondary color, with a lighter tone for each one. Color palette is based on purples. <b>But why choosing this color?</b>
                  Purple is associated with wisdom, dignity, independence, creativity, mystery, and magic. We believe that tattoos are a way to express ourselves <b>(creativity)</b> in the way we want, being clear or just with subtle touches
                  <b>(mystery)</b> in the only way you want. This is the <b>magic</b> that resembles tattoo world.
                </p>
                <p><b>Text</b> is simple, I used Roboto typography since it matches perfectly the app style, being very easy to read and clear. I played with sizes and bold/regular, to create different sensation with the same typography.</p>
                <p>Talking about <b>corners</b>, there are two types, completely round or slightely. It can be seen for example on buttons, which follow this guides.</p>-->

                  <p>Of course, on a video game website, it's a must to have a place where games are described deeply and where users can express their approve or disapprove of them. This way they feel part of a community and that way I make sure they know that their opinion matters.</p>

                  Along this project I learned to take the time needed for every individual part and indulge each one as they should be. This way is the best to get everything done correctly, so you won’t have to go back and forward to make sure
                  everything is done as it should. It might sound obvious, but sometime the desire to continue and impatiente to see the final result may take the control and you can obviate things that shouldn’t or forget to consider important
                  thing.

                <p>
                  I loved doing this app and learning from everything I’ve done. I think it’s impressive to see how many people think differentely, but at the same time they want the same. Why I say this? Because while developing the app, I could
                  talk with a lot of people and many of them gave different ideas of what they wanted, and I had to thought about a way of making a common point for them, since the main objective was to help on the tattoo community with my project.
