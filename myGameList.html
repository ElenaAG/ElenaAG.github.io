              The number of video game consumers increases every year and its market offer is wide, oscillating between consoles (Xbox, PC, switch, PlayStation ...), genres or personal interests. When the user wants to find a video game suitable for
              the him/her, this issue can sometimes be overwhelming, so an online recommender that shows options according to what the user is looking for is a widely satisfactory tool.

                    Not only studying the market is necessary. Knowing the target audience and knowing what their real needs are is essential for the good development of the product. They are the end users, the consumers, they must be heard. I
                    consider that this is the best way to know exactly what they are looking for. For this I conducted personal interviews with a group of regular players and certain online surveys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the online surveys I focused mainly on establishing a ranking of priorities in terms of filtering searches, to find out what they consider more basic and what not, or more secondary. This will be important and will be clearly
                    reflected in how the searches will be structured.

              Even though, where I could gather more information was from the interviews. From them I got very valuable information to create a really interesting website for the user and not one to only use very occasionally. The most important
              point is to keep the web up to date with news and information from video games, mainly on issues of updates or bugs, offers, etc. The idea is not to create a news blog, but to show users which games have the most attention from their
              creators.

                    Actually there is <b>not a clear reference</b> for a online video game recommender. There are just a bunch of different websites that seems to just show them mighty interesting video games, but not having in consideration users
                    real likes or what they are more interested about.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the same time <b>navigation and usability</b> is very poor in most of these websites. This is very important due to people tend to perceive attractive products as more usable. <b>Marketing strategy and SEO</b> is very poor on
                    this websites too.

                    On the other hand, even though a video game recommender is an element every video game consumer will like to use from time to time, just with that service it <b>isn’t enough</b> to create an stable website. That said, creating a
                    <b>community</b> which players can punctuate and comment which games they like most or no is a very interesting idea. Also creating <b>reward system</b> having in consideration users contributions making their profile stand out
                    and establishing a ranking.

                  Information about which games have updates, next releases, etc. is another big point to consider, along with facilitating access to buy them.

                    All of them are profiles that benefit from being able to filter searches, but you have to take into account that not everyone reaches with the same level of depth, so you have to establish a good hierarchy so that it is both

                    To begin to know how our website should be structured it is very useful to create a map with the path that a user would take in a given scenario and with a clear objective. Such as buying a new game. I decided to create 3, each with an action that could be performed by any of the people created in the previous step and divided into different phases according to the actions that are required.

For example, thanks to the map shown in the image, I could be able to detect how important it is not to make the search too long, as it will cause the user to get bored. Do not let him lose that emotion of looking for a new game to enjoy.

                The next step was <b>wireframing</b>. Once I knew what I wanted and defined the core functionalities, I started creating low-fidelity wireframes, in order to get a
                more reliable design, but still being able to change this easily.
                Finally, <b>mockups</b>. Once the previous phase was totally clear, it was time to start creating some final designs.

                  Before continuing, I created a simple prototype to test by myself how intuitive the app was, did the changes necessary and after that, I conducted some usability tests with 6 people from my target audience. I asked the testers to do
                  3 different actions from the core features. During the test, I observed users actions and asked them to think aloud as much as possible, so I could take notes on everything they noticed, good and bad things.

                    profile there will be another important feature. People who has done a tattoo by them, will be able to post a comment on their profile and punctuate artist. This way when people search for an artist, can see also what other people

                <p>
                  Along this project I learned to take the time needed for every individual part and indulge each one as they should be. This way is the best to get everything done correctly, so you won’t have to go back and forward to make sure
                  everything is done as it should. It might sound obvious, but sometime the desire to continue and impatiente to see the final result may take the control and you can obviate things that shouldn’t or forget to consider important
                  thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I loved doing this app and learning from everything I’ve done. I think it’s impressive to see how many people think differentely, but at the same time they want the same. Why I say this? Because while developing the app, I could
                  talk with a lot of people and many of them gave different ideas of what they wanted, and I had to thought about a way of making a common point for them, since the main objective was to help on the tattoo community with my project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think I’ve managed to commit my objective, with an app where you can search and filter results of tattoos, studios and artist. Just in one app you can do several things and create your boards, so you can organize pics as you want.
                  Also you can talk and request an appointment with an artist or an artist show his/her portfolio. This app is a way to simplify every tattoo lovers needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hope you liked it!
